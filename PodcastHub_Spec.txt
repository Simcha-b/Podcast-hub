Podcast Aggregator Backend - Project Specification
Project Overview
Project Name: PodcastHub - Multi-Source Podcast Aggregator
 Duration: 5 days maximum

 Storage: File-based (JSON files as database)
Project Goal
Build a backend service that aggregates podcast episodes from multiple RSS feeds, processes the data, and provides a REST API for querying podcast information. The system will demonstrate comprehensive Go programming concepts while creating a practical, real-world application.
Core Functionality
The system will:
Fetch and parse RSS feeds from multiple podcast sources
Store podcast data in JSON files (acting as a file-based database)
Process and enrich podcast metadata
Provide REST API endpoints for data access
Implement concurrent feed processing
Handle data persistence and caching
Generate statistics and analytics
